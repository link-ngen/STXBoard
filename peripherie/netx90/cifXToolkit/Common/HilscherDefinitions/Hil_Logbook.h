  Definitions for the Hilscher firmware Logbook.

  \note In this file the Type IDs will be managed (HIL_LOGBOOK_ENTRY_TYPE_*) definitions
        are only made here. There is no structure to the type values, the next value is
        acquired directly after the last one. It is not desired to reserve numbers, this
        shall avoid dead number ranges and gaps between the types.

  \note This list is maintained by the protocol stack department (SPC).

  In the description the python like format strings will be used to give information over
  a possible presentation. (https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html#formatspec)
  the parameter will by "selected" by position e.g.
    "{0} {1}" -> first and second member of structure.
