/*! \defgroup HIL_GCI_AcyclicServices Acyclic Services
 * The Generic Communication Interface (GCI) defines a acyclic bidirectional communication interface
 * between a GCI-Application and a GCI-Component.
 *
 * The GCI-Component and GCI-Application interact by means of services. Each of this services has a defined data structure
 * which is passed along with the service.
 *
 * Services are symmetrically defined by the GCI-Application and the GCI-Component:
 *  - The GCI-Component implements services which are called "requests" (*_REQ) to be used by the GCI-Application and for
 *    each of them, the GCI-Application correspondingly implements a service which is called "confirmation" (*_CNF).
 *    The confirmation is the acknowledgment of the request.
 *
 *  - In opposite direction, the GCI-Application implements services which are called "indications" (*_IND) to be used
 *    by the GCI-Component and for each of them, the GCI-Component corresponding implements a service which is called
 *    "response" (*_RES). The response is the acknowledgment of the indication.
 *
 * Each service is assigned an unique number called the command code.
 *
 * Per definition, all service initiated by the GCI-Application are named requests and all services initiated by the
 * GCI-Component are named indications.
 *
 * Based on this interface, the GCI allows to define such pairs of services to implement interaction in a call and
 * reply fashion for, e.g., the following purposes:
 *    - Configuration
 *    - Exchange of acyclic data
 *    - Diagnostics
 *

/*! Handle of an acyclic service.

 * identifies the transaction between the GCI-Application and the GCI-Component related to this service.
